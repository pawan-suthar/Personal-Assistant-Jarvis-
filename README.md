PROPOSED SYSTEM

It was an interesting task to make my own assistant. It became easier to send 
emails without typing any word, Searching on Google without opening the browser, 
and performing many other daily tasks like playing music, opening your favorite IDE
with the help of a single voice command. Jarvis is different from other traditional voice 
assistants in terms that it is specific to desktop and user does not need to make account 
to use this, it does not require any internet connection while getting the instructions to 
perform any specific task but need for internet related tasks.


The IDE used in this project is VScode. All the python files were created in 
VScode and all the necessary packages were easily installable in this IDE. For this 
project following modules and libraries were used i.e. pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, 
Datetime, Wikipedia, Smtplib, pyautogui etc. 


With the advancement JARVIS can perform any task with same effectiveness or 
can say more effectively than us. By making this project, I realized that the concept of 
AI in every field is decreasing human effort and saving time. Functionalities of this 
project include, It can send emails, It can read PDF, It can send text on WhatsApp, It 
can open command prompt, your favorite IDE, notepad etc., It can play music, It can
do Wikipedia searches for you, It can open websites like Google, YouTube, etc., in a 
web browser, It can give weather forecast. It can have some basic conversation.


  
## USABILITY

Usability of a system is checked by measuring the easiness of the 
software and how user friendly it is for the user to use, how it responses to 
each query that is being asked by the user

It makes it easier to complete any task as it automatically do it by using 
the essential module or libraries of Python, in a conversational interaction 
way. Hence any user when instruct any task to it, they feel like giving task to 
a human assistant because of the conversational interaction for giving input 
and getting the desired output in the form of task done.

The desktop assistant is reactive which means it know human 
language very well and understand the context that is provided by the user 
and gives response in the same way, i.e. human understandable language, 
English. So user finds its reaction in an informed and smart way.


The main application of it can be its multitasking ability. It can ask for 
continuous instruction one after other until the user ‚ÄúQUIT‚Äù it. It asks for the 
instruction and listen the response that is given by user without needing any 
trigger phase and then only executes the task.

## SECURITY
The security testing mainly focuses on vulnerabilities and risks. As 
JARVIS is a local desktop application, hence there is no risk of data 
breaching through remote access. The software is dedicated to a specific 
system so when the user logs in, it will be activated.

## STABILITY
Stability of a system depends upon the output of the system, if the 
output is bounded and specific to the bounded input then the system is said to 
be stable. If the system works on all the poles of functionality then it is 
stable


## LIMITATIONS
Security is somewhere an issue, there is no voice command encryption in this 
project.
Background voice can interfere
Misinterpretation because of accents and may cause inaccurate results.

JARVIS cannot be called externally anytime like other traditional assistants 
like Google Assistant can be called just by saying, ‚ÄúOk Google!‚Äù

## SCOPE FOR FUTURE WORK
Make JARVIS to learn more on its own and develop a new skill in it.
JARVIS android app can also be developed.
Make more Jarvis voice terminals.
Voice commands can be encrypted to maintain security
